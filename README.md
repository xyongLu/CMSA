The code will be released after the manuscript is published.

# Introduction

- Low-resolution images pose challenges for accurate feature extraction in vision tasks.
- CMSA addresses this by enhancing multi-scale feature extraction and interactions effectively. 
- CMSA employs a novel cascaded attention mechanism to facilitate multi-scale feature integration, replacing the downsampling operations that often result in substantial information loss in low-resolution contexts.
- Experimental results demonstrate that this method boosts performance in practical applications such as human pose estimation, head pose estimation, and more with low-resolution images.
